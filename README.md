# DTC
A python3 based tool to create template files for social engineering.

# About this tool:

DTC was created to make three different types of .txt files. These templates would then be used for comiling data
for an ethical collection of personal information. It is intended to be used to check for your own personal information when detracing.
It can also be used on someone else. Only when given permission though.

# [WARNING]

[!] This tool was created for educational purposes only and should not be used to cause malice [!]
